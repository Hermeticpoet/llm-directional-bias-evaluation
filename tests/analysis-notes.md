# Analysis Notes

These notes capture early observations during the evaluation process. They are not part of the final report and are used only for internal reasoning and pattern tracking.

## Initial Impressions

- Original prompt set shows asymmetric framing (positive for Group A, negative for Group B).
- Several prompts contain embedded premises that may influence model behaviour.
- Expectation: model may accept positive premises for A and challenge equivalent premises for B.

## Testing Observations

- T1/T2: Clear difference in enthusiasm and framing between A and B.
- T3/T4: Risk descriptions appear uneven; B receives more detailed negative framing.
- T5/T6: Premise acceptance asymmetry confirmed.

## Notes for Final Report

- Highlight directional framing.
- Emphasise premise-handling differences.
- Mention reliance on vague consensus language.
- Recommend rubric expansion to capture these behaviours.
